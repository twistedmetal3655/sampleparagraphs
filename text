She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. It was the next step that was the most important.
The river slowly meandered through the open space. It had hidden secrets that it didn't want to reveal. It had a well-planned strategy to appear calm, inviting, and appealing. That's how the river lured her unknowing victims to her water's edge.
She's asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a general sense. A more accurate description was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time, "What's your favorite animal?" But this time was different. When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly.
It probably seemed trivial to most people, but it mattered to Tracey. She wasn't sure why it mattered so much to her, but she understood deep within her being that it mattered to her. So for the 365th day in a row, Tracey sat down to eat pancakes for breakfast.
She closed her eyes and then opened them again. What she was seeing just didn't make sense. She shook her head seeing if that would help. It didn't. Although it seemed beyond reality, there was no denying she was witnessing a large formation of alien spaceships filling the sky.
I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be." That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that "meant to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. It's the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie.
There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless. That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone.
It really doesn't matter what she thinks as it isn't her problem to solve. That's what he kept trying to convince himself. She was trying to insert her opinion where it wasn't wanted or welcome. He already had a plan and even though that plan didn't correspond with what she wanted him to do or what should be done, it wasn't her decision to make. The question now became whether he would stick to his convictions and go through with his plan knowing she wouldn't approve.
The blinking light caught her attention. She thought about it a bit and couldn't remember ever noticing it before. That was strange since it was obvious the flashing light had been there for years. Now she wondered how she missed it for that amount of time and what other things in her small town she had failed to notice.
The desert wind blew the tumbleweed in front of the car. Alex swerved to avoid the tumbleweed, but he turned the wheel a bit too strong and the car left the road and skidded onto the dirt median. He instantly slammed on the brakes and the car stopped in a cloud of dirt. When the dust cloud had settled and he could see around him again, he realized that he'd somehow crossed over into an entirely new dimension.
He was after the truth. At least, that's what he told himself. He believed it, but any rational person on the outside could see he was lying to himself. It was apparent he was really only after his own truth that he'd already decided and was after this truth because the facts didn't line up with the truth he wanted. So he continued to tell everyone he was after the truth oblivious to the real truth sitting right in front of him.
It was a question of which of the two she preferred. On the one hand, the choice seemed simple. The more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most. It was the easy choice. The safe choice. But she wasn't sure she actually preferred it.
I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be." That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that "meant to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. It's the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie.
She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. "You need to learn to think for yourself," she wanted to tell him. "Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down." But she didn't because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never give them up.
He hid under the covers hoping that nobody would notice him there. It really didn't make much sense since it would be obvious to anyone who walked into the room there was someone hiding there, but he still held out hope. He heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop in front in front of the bedroom door. He heard the squeak of the door hinges and someone opened the bedroom door. He held his breath waiting for whoever was about to discover him, but they never did.
Brenda never wanted to be famous. While most of her friends dreamed about being famous, she could see the negative aspects that those who wanted to be famous seemed to ignore. The fact that you could never do anything in public without being mobbed and the complete lack of privacy was something that she never wanted to experience. She also had no desire to have strangers speculating about every aspect of her life and what each thing she did was supposed to mean. Brenda was perfectly happy with her anonymous life where she could do exactly as she wanted without anyone else giving a damn. Thus, her overnight Internet celebrity was not something she was thrilled about as her friends told her how lucky she was.
What were they eating? It didn't taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished, she didn't dare ask. She knew the answer would be one she didn't want to hear.
Betty was a creature of habit and she thought she liked it that way. That was until Dave showed up in her life. She now had a choice to make and it would determine whether her lie remained the same or if it would change forever.
She has seen this scene before. It had come to her in dreams many times before. She had to pinch herself to make sure it wasn't a dream again. As her fingers squeezed against her arm, she felt the pain. It was this pain that immediately woke her up.
There were about twenty people on the dam. Most of them were simply walking and getting exercise. There were a few who were fishing. There was a family who had laid down a blanket and they were having a picnic. It was like this most days and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The problem was that nobody noticed the water leaking through the dam wall.
The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.
Green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy. Ants used the vine as their private highway, avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark, to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore. At least this was the way it was supposed to be. Something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway.
The bowl was filled with fruit. It seemed to be an overabundance of strawberries, but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices. This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start her day since she could remember. Why she decided to add chocolate as an option today was still a bit of a surprise, but she had been in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine. This was a baby step to begin that start.
He sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time. It wasn't. Had it been a hundred? It quite possibly could have been. Two hundred? Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time.
"Can I get you anything else?" David asked. It was a question he asked a hundred times a day and he always received the same answer. It had become such an ingrained part of his daily routine that he had to step back and actively think when he heard the little girl's reply. Nobody had before answered the question the way that she did, and David didn't know how he should respond.
Mary had to make a decision and she knew that whatever decision she made, it would upset someone. It seemed like such a silly reason for people to get upset but she knew the minute that she began to consider doing it that there was no way everyone in her life would be pleased with what she ultimately decided to do. It was simply a question of who she would rather displease most. While this had always been her parents, and especially her mom, in the past that she tried to keep from upsetting, she decided that this time the person she was going to please the most with her decision was herself.
The answer was within her reach. It was hidden in a box and now that box sat directly in front of her. She'd spent years searching for it and could hardly believe she'd finally managed to find it. She turned the key to unlock the box and then gently lifted the top. She held her breath in anticipation of finally knowing the answer she had spent so much of her time in search of. As the lid came off she could see that the box was empty.
She tried to explain that love wasn't like pie. There wasn't a set number of slices to be given out. There wasn't less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another. That after a set amount was given out it would all disappear. She tried to explain this, but it fell on deaf ears.
I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be." That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that "meant to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. It's the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie.
The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared. It had seemed they'd always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again, but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in another.

Chapter 1
I
n my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever
since.
“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just
remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”
He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually
communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not
a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and
attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person,
and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of
wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought —
frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate
revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I
am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as
my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a
sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally
at birth.
And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the
admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the
hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t
care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last
autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a
sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous
4
excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only
Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt
from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for
which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken
series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises
of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines
that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic
readiness such as I have never found in any other person and
which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby
turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby,
what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and shortwinded elations of men.
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this
Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are
something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my
line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one,
sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale
hardware business that my father carries on to-day.
I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like
him — with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting
that hangs in father’s office I graduated from New Haven in
1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little
later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known
as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that
I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the
world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of
the universe — so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and
uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for
me, and finally said, “Why — ye — es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after
various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the
spring of twenty-two.
5
The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a
warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and
friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested
that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded
like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the
firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country
alone. I had a dog — at least I had him for a few days until he
ran away — and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made
my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to
herself over the electric stove.
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,
more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.
I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a
guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves
growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had
that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with
the summer.
There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine
health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I
bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment
securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new
money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets
that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had
the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was
rather literary in college — one year I wrote a series of very
solemn and obvious editorials for the “Yale News.”— and now I
was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.
It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house
in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was
on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of
New York — and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the
city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and
6
separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great
wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. they are not perfect ovals
— like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed
flat at the contact end — but their physical resemblance must
be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their
dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the — well, the less fashionable of the
two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre
and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was
at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and
squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or
fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal
affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some
Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking
new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming
pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was
Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it
was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own
house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had
been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of
my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires
— all for eighty dollars a month.
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East
Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer
really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner
with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I
spent two days with them in Chicago.
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had
been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at
New Haven — a national figure in a way, one of those men who
reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that
everything afterward savors of anti-climax. His family were
enormously wealthy — even in college his freedom with money
was a matter for reproach — but now he’d left Chicago and
come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for
instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake
7
Forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation
was wealthy enough to do that.
Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in
France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and
there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich
together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it — I had no sight into Daisy’s
heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little
wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable
football game.
And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove
over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew
at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a
cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking
the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the
front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and
brick walks and burning gardens — finally when it reached the
house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the
momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French
windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to
the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding
clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.
He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a
sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and
a supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of
always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate
swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of
that body — he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he
strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of
muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It
was a body capable of enormous leverage — a cruel body.
His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked — and there
were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.
“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he
seemed to say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man
than you are.” We were in the same senior society, and while
we were never intimate I always had the impression that he
8
approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh,
defiant wistfulness of his own.
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.
Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand
along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian
garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed
motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.
“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around
again, politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored
space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at
either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against
the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into
the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at
one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled
over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does
on the sea.
The only completely stationary object in the room was an
enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up
as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white,
and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had
just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I
must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and
snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.
Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the
curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned
slowly to the floor.
The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless,
and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing
something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out
of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it — indeed, I was
almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.
The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise — she leaned
slightly forward with a conscientious expression — then she
9
laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too
and came forward into the room.
“I’m p-paralyzed with happiness.” She laughed again, as if
she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment,
looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the
world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She
hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was
Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to
make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made
it no less charming.)
At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back
again — the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a
little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete selfsufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.
I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in
her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of
notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and
lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men
who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had done
gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,
exciting things hovering in the next hour.
I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my
way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through
me.
“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.
“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear
wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”
“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. To-morrow!” Then she
added irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”
“I’d like to.”
“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen
her?”
“Never.”
“Well, you ought to see her. She’s ——”
10
Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the
room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.
“What you doing, Nick?”
“I’m a bond man.”
“Who with?”
I told him.
“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.
This annoyed me.
“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the
East.”
“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing
at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something
more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”
At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started — it was the first word she uttered since
I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it
did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.
“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for
as long as I can remember.”
“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get
you to New York all afternoon.”
“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in
from the pantry, “I’m absolutely in training.”
Her host looked at her incredulously.
“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the
bottom of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond
me.”
I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got
done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, smallbreasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by
throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite
reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face.
It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her,
somewhere before.
“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I
know somebody there.”
“I don’t know a single ——”
“You must know Gatsby.”
11
“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”
Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom
Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were
moving a checker to another square.
Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the
two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch,
open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the
table in the diminished wind.
“Why CANDLES?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped
them out with her fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest
day in the year.” She looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always
watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always
watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”
“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting
down at the table as if she were getting into bed.
“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me
helplessly: “What do people plan?”
Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.
“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”
We all looked — the knuckle was black and blue.
“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t
mean to, but you DID do it. That’s what I get for marrying a
brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a
——”
“I hate that word hulking,” objected Tom crossly, “even in
kidding.”
“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.
Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively
and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here, and they
accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to
entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner
would be over and a little later the evening too would be over
and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West,
where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its
close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in
sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.
12
“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my
second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you
talk about crops or something?”
I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken
up in an unexpected way.
“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve
gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read
‘The Rise of the Colored Empires’ by this man Goddard?”
“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.
“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The
idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be — will be utterly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”
“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long
words in them. What was that word we ——”
“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing
at her impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole
thing. It’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or
these other races will have control of things.”
“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.
“You ought to live in California —” began Miss Baker, but
Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.
“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you
are, and ——” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included
Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “— And
we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization — oh,
science and art, and all that. Do you see?”
There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his
complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him
any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.
“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.
“It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the
butler’s nose?”
“That’s why I came over to-night.”
“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for
